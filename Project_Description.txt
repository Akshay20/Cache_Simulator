Design and implement a parametric cache simulator and use it to design data caches suited to solve systems of linear equations. The simulator should model a memory
hierarchy with data and victim cache. Assume the LRU replacement policy and (i) write back with write allocate, and (ii) write through with no-write allocate policies. 



The simulator should accept the following inputs: 
• Date cache size in bytes
• Associativity
• Block size in bytes
• Write policy
• Victim cache size in blocks. Note that if this input is zero then the system does 
not have a victim cache.



The simulator should output at least the following statistics: 


 
• Number of L1 reads
• Number of L1 read misses
• Number of victim cache reads
• Number of victim cache read misses
• Number of L1 writes
• Number of L1 write misses
• Number of victim cache writes
• Number of victim cache write misses
• L1 miss rate
• Victim cache miss rate
• Total memory traffic to/from main memory
